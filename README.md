## About The Project

![Picture of the apps front page][ui-url]

Killer Sudoku Calculator lets you calculate all possible combinations for cages.
You can set the target sum required by the cage and the size of the cage according to the puzzle.
If you have already figured out some numbers that have to be inside the cage, you can simply add them to the calculation by ticking the boxes of the needed numbers.
This works vice versa with the numbers that can't be inside the cage.
